# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This project presents an analysis of Netflix's content library to explore trends in genres, release years, ratings, and more. Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize patterns and gain insights into Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows.
## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed information on Netflix's movie and TV show offerings, covering various aspects like cast, country of origin, duration, and genre. Here are the key columns:

* **Cast:** Main actors in the show or movie
* **Country:** Country where the content was produced
* **Date Added:** Date the content was added to Netflix
* **Description:** Short summary of the content
* **Director:** Director of the content
* **Duration:** Runtime for movies or number of seasons for TV shows
* **Listed In:** Genre/category tags for each title
* **Rating:** Content rating (e.g., PG, R)
* **Release Year:** Year the content was originally released
* **Show ID:** Unique identifier for each title
* **Title:** Name of the movie or show
* **Type:** Indicates whether the content is a movie or TV show

## Project Goals
The dashboard aims to:

1. Analyze content trends in terms of genre, country, and release year.

2. Identify the most common types of content and genre preferences on Netflix.

3. Provide insights into content rating distributions and audience targeting.

4. Create an interactive exploration tool for Netflix's movie and TV show data.

## Features of the Dashboard
**1. Genre Distribution:** A bar chart that shows the distribution of genres/categories (based on “Listed In”).

**2. Release Year Trends:** A line graph showing content release trends over time to visualize changes in Netflix’s content strategy.

**3. Ratings Distribution:** Visuals showing how content ratings (like PG, R, etc.) vary across different genres and countries.

**4. Interactive Filters:** Users can filter by type (movie or TV show), release year, genre, and country to personalize their exploration.
## Key Insights
Some notable insights from the analysis:
* **Genre Popularity:** Certain genres are more frequently featured on Netflix, which may indicate audience targeting strategies.
* **Yearly Content Trends:** Content release trends reflect Netflix’s changing focus over time, with specific spikes or shifts for certain genres or countries.
* **Rating Patterns:** The distribution of ratings provides insight into audience age demographics and regional content suitability.
